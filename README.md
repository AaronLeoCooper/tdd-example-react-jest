# TDD Example - React, Redux, Jest & Enzyme

This is an example project used to showcase a basic project setup and TDD workflow involving
**React, Redux, Jest & Enzyme** 

## Installation

[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) is the preferred package manager for this project, although *NPM*
commands should also still work as expected.

- Initial setup: `yarn install` (or `npm install`)
- Run locally: `yarn start` (or `npm start`)
- Run tests once, with coverage: `yarn test` (or `npm test`)
- Run tests continuously as files change: `yarn test:watch` (or `npm run test:watch`)
- Run ESLint once: `yarn lint` (or `npm run lint`)
- Building the application for serving: `yarn build` (or `npm run build`)

## Useful resources

These are a few resources I've found myself going back to many times during React app development
over the last few years:

- [DevDocs](https://devdocs.io) - very nice, simple, customisable, to-the-point documentation for
  many, many languages, frameworks and libraries
